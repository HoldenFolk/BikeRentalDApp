All team members participated evenly for this part of the projet.

How we worked: 
-   We have set individual milestones to achieve from one team meeting to another via Issues
-   Each member worked on his part of the project using his branch to avoid overwritting each other when working at the same time and used team meetings to merge everything without conflicts 
-   We normally met monday and wednesday after class and once during the weekend
-   We had a discord group chat where we called for online meeting
