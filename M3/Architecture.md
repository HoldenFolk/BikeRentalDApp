# Milestone 3: Architecture/Design

## Architectural Design Decisions and Models 
  

Our design looks to create a new bike sharing platforms while respecting the principals of privacy by design to build a application that provides complete anonymity to the user. This application, running on a decentralized blockchain system, will not require any personal identifiers to use at the sacrifice of some minor features.

  

Represented below is the UML class diagram that describes the structure of the application.

The UML diagram outlines how we plan to implement the privacy centered system. The application will allow users to create account; however, no personal identifiers will be required to sign up. Instead of the typical payment information stored to make credit card transactions, our application looks to make all payments over blockchain. This ensures complete anonymity while sacrificing minor accessibility to the user. The user will now have to create and link a wallet to make payments within the application.
