## Pixi Privacy Policy

Welcome to Pixi, the privacy-focused bike sharing service. At Pixi, we're committed to maintaining the trust and confidence of our users. Our approach to privacy is simple: we collect minimal data and prioritize your privacy at every step. This privacy policy outlines how we handle your personal information in line with our commitment to privacy.

### Information We Collect

In order to provide a seamless bike sharing experience while prioritizing your privacy, we collect and encrypt the following information:

- **Start Time & Station**: The time and location from where your bike journey begins.
- **End Time & Station**: The time and location where your bike journey concludes.

This information is encrypted and stored within our system and a copy is maintained on our smart contract on the blockchain. The data is only kept for 24 hours if the contract is not broken.

### Use of Information

The collected information is used solely for the purpose of facilitating bike sharing services and ensuring compliance with our user agreement. The encrypted data serves to:

- Track the usage of our bikes for operational purposes.
- Ensure bikes are returned to designated stations within the stipulated time frame.

### Data Encryption & Access

We take your privacy seriously:

- **Encryption**: All user information is encrypted from the moment of collection. This means that the data is unreadable to us and anyone else without the decryption key.
- **Access to Information**: The encrypted information is accessed (decrypted) only if a user breaches our contract, such as by stealing the bike. This action is taken to pursue recovery of the property and/or legal action against the individual responsible. This information may be shared with third parties in order to pursue the malicient actor.

### Open Source Verification

In line with our commitment to transparency and privacy, our system's source code is open source. This means that any user or interested party can review the code to verify that we collect only the information mentioned and that it remains encrypted and inaccessible to us or anyone else without just cause.

### Data Retention

We retain the encrypted data for a period necessary to ensure compliance with our user agreement and to facilitate the efficient operation of our service. Once this period expires, the data is securely deleted from our systems and the blockchain in accordance with our data retention policy.


### Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We encourage you to review our privacy policy periodically.
