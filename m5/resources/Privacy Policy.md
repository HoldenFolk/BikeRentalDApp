## Pixi Privacy Policy

Welcome to Pixi, the privacy-focused bike sharing service. At Pixi, we're committed to maintaining the trust and confidence of our users. Our approach to privacy is simple: we collect minimal data and prioritize your privacy at every step. This privacy policy outlines how we handle your personal information in line with our commitment to privacy.

### Information We Collect

In order to provide a seamless bike sharing experience while prioritizing your privacy, we collect and encrypt the following information:

- **Start Time & Station**: The time and location from where your bike journey begins.
- **End Time & Station**: The time and location where your bike journey concludes.
- **Cost of the trip**: The amount of ETH that we received for that trip.
- **Doubly encrypted personal information**: This is only collected when you provide it to us to pay a smaller deposit. 

This information is stored within our system and an encrypted copy is available on our smart contract on the blockchain. 

### Use of Information

The collected information is used solely for the purpose of facilitating bike sharing services. The encrypted data serves to:

- Track the usage of our bikes for operational purposes.
- Ensure bikes are returned to designated stations within 24 hours after the rental begins.

### Data Encryption & Access

We take your privacy seriously:

- **Encryption**: All user information is encrypted from the moment of collection. This means that the data is unreadable to us and anyone else without the decryption key.
- **Access to Information**: The encrypted information is accessed (decrypted) only if the user hasn't returned the bike within 24 hours after he initiated the rental. This action is taken to pursue recovery of the property and/or legal action against the responsible individual. This information may be shared with third parties including but not limited to a court or a lawyer in order to pursue the thief.

### Open Source Verification

In line with our commitment to transparency and privacy, our system's source code is open source. This means that any user or interested party can review the code to verify that we collect only the information mentioned and that it remains encrypted and inaccessible to us or anyone else apart from the aforementioned theft scenario.

### Data Retention

We retain the encrypted data personal data only if the bike was not returned. The data is deleted once PIXI has received compensation for the theft of the bike.

### Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will notify the users if that were to happen.
