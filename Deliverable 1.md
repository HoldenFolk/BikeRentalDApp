## Mobility apps and privacy, a case study on the BIXI app

I am adding this to test

BIXI: 
- It’s a useful service
- Before we used to be able to use a key that you previously purchased in order to unlock a bike. It made this service less accessible to the public. All users are invited to download the application, and to even know that a Bixi key is an option, the user has to look it up. 

Main problem is storing individual data in a non-private way (allowing a 3rd party to track back to the individual in case of a leak). Also a problem about diffusing aggregated stats that could let people be singled out. 


(The big questions)
1.
What we think Bixi actually need in order to work: 


What it asks for (what it collects):


2.
Its predecessor:
FIrst it was kiosk based with a credit card. You could subscribe to a membership and receive a card/key allowing you to unlock your BIXI. The mobile app was introduced in 2013. They kept concurrent services until 2021 when they decided to remove the key/card option “to limit plastic pollution” (and gather a ton of valuable data on all their users). However you can still get a BIXI key if you call them and make a 15$ payment (they will ship it to you). They still maintain a database with all your personal information and ride history though, as the key is linked to your account. They can hence record the location and time when you took the bike as well as when you returned it, with the info being linked to your profile. 

The differences:


3.
The privacy threats:


The privacy policy:


Where is the line (what user thinks they give vs what they actually give)





Citation from a BIXI employee who started working there in 2010: “We know our users very, very well” (1). Users’ patterns are analyzed, Blain explained, and with nearly six years of data collected, Blain is able to make very accurate predictions.


**Introduction**

- What is the technology transition
- What is the application of this technology 
- What are the privacy implications of the technology transition 

**Research Method**

- State what the research questions are
    - For each quesiton state what we need to do to answer these questions and analyse the data
    - The results of this analysis will then be added to the results section

**Results** 

- Findings from research. What insights are there into BIXI 
- Are there any studies or research done into the privacy implications of this technology
- Have there been other attempts to solve this issue? What can we learn from these?

**Conclusion**
	
- How does all this data relate to the privacy violations?
- Here is where we will include the insights that we find from the data.
- What the results mean and why are they important
