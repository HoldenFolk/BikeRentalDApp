## Privacy Implications of Online Bike Sharing Services and Possible Solutions

#### Studies and Researches

- In general, the problem with these online bike sharing services is that they collect the users' information, and then publish the bike sharing dataset after removing the users' identity. However, an adversary may with some research link this information to a user and breach their privacy. This theme was explored in a research paper, [An Effective Grouping Method for Privacy-Preserving Bike Sharing Data Publishing](https://www.mdpi.com/1999-5903/9/4/65). This study suggests a grouping-based anonymization (explained in detail in the paper), this technique would help protect each user's personal information by making it a lot harder, even impossible for an adversary to link the information to a user due to the grouping and anonymization. Moreover, this technique retains higher data utility for analysis purposes compared to other anonymization techniques. Therefore, it is a good balanced solution that protects the users' privacy while maximizing the data utility.

- Bixi is a bike sharing service that uses docks, however in the future, it might become dockless. This evolution would come with its pricay implications. In fact, Lime, which is a transportation company that runs electric bikes all around the world based in San Francisco, California, is able to map your movement because of its bikes. Indeed, since they are built to operate without stations, the bikes transmit their location every few seconds, thus Lime knows where a ride starts and ends, and the whole route of the bike during the ride. This comes with its fair share of privacy implications. If a leak were to happen, adversaries could track people precisely, they could know where the users live, where they work, their habits, and many more private information.
