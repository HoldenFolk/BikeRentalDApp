## Privacy Implications of Online Bike Sharing Services and Possible Solutions

#### Studies and Researches

In general, the problem with these online bike sharing services is that they collect the users' information, and then publish the bike sharing dataset after removing the users' identity. However, an adversary may with some research link this information to a user and breach their privacy. This theme was explored in a research paper, [An Effective Grouping Method for Privacy-Preserving Bike Sharing Data Publishing](https://www.mdpi.com/1999-5903/9/4/65). This study suggests a grouping-based anonymization (explained in detail in the paper), this technique would help protect each user's personal information by making it a lot harder, even impossible for an adversary to link the information to a user due to the grouping and anonymization. Moreover, this technique retains higher data utility for analysis purposes compared to other anonymization techniques. Therefore, it is a good balanced solution that protects the users' privacy while maximizing the data utility.
