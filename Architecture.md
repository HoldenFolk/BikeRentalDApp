Entrust data to a third party organization. The nonprofit organization Shared Streets recently announced a partnership with Uber and Lyft to make data about rideshare usage and road speeds available to cities. These companies have previously resisted data sharing with cities citing privacy and commercial grounds. Shared Streets was able to get data access by providing a mechanism for sharing with built in privacy protections. Alternatively, Sean McDonald has proposed the idea of a Civic Trust, a novel legal structure in which data would be held for the benefit of the public and overseen by an open, participatory governance structure that would decide how it could be used and shared.
